Proprtions of all scenes and dervied water scene proportion
}
\details{
The water proportion is defined as all pixels that are "correctly" classified
as water. Thus, disturbances that occur but are not a false classification
like clouds, snow or topographic impacts need to be removed before. After
removing those pixels, the water classifiation should be 100\% for a perfect
pixel
