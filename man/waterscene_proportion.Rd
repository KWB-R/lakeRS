\arguments{
\item{scl_image}{The SCL layer of the image-wise data, created by one of the
index per image functions: \code{\link[=ndi_per_image]{ndi_per_image()}}, \code{\link[=additive_per_image]{additive_per_image()}}}
}
\value{
A list of 3:
\itemize{
\item the water scene proportion per pixel
\item the disturbance scene proportion per pixel
\item A list of all individual scene proportions per pixel
}
}
\description{
Proprtions of all scenes and dervied water scene proportion
}
\details{
The water proportion is defined as all pixels that are "correctly" classified
as water. Thus, disturbances that occur but are not a false classification
like clouds, snow or topographic impacts need to be removed before. After
removing those pixels, the water classifiation should be 100\% for a perfect
pixel
