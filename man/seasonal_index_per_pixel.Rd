  seasonMonths = 4:10,

\arguments{
\item{nc}{The netCDF data list created by \code{\link[=load_netcdf]{load_netcdf()}}}

\item{ncImage}{the data list created by \code{\link[=ndi_per_image]{ndi_per_image()}}}

\item{years}{Numeric vector of all the years to be assessed}

\item{seasonMonths}{Numeric vector including all months of the growing season}

\item{water_scenes_only}{By default only pixels classified as water scene are
used for the yearly average per pixel. If False, all values are included no
except for cloud and snow scenes.}

\item{pixelQualityThreshold}{The quality is defined as the minimum proportion
a pixel needs to be defined as water scene to be included.}

\item{lakeInfo}{Character vector of length 2 specifying the Name and the ID
of the lake. This is not needed for any calculation but is important to
identify the lake.}
}
\value{
A list of
\itemize{
\item lakeInfo: A character of lake Name and ID or whatever is provided as
meta data#
\item A list per season
\itemize{
\item RSindex: A Matrix of the whole rechtangle containing the index per pixel
for the whole season
\item QualityThreshold: The minimum proportion a pixel is required to be
identified as water during one season
\item minValuesPerPixel: The mininum number of images used for index calculation
ofone pixel (Quality_threshold x Images_of_Season)
\item validPixel: The number of pixels above Quality Threshold
