\arguments{
\item{outputPath}{The path of the Remote Sensing data. One level above input
and output folder}

\item{nc}{The netCDF data list created by \code{\link[=load_netcdf]{load_netcdf()}}}

\item{ncImage}{the data list created by \code{\link[=ndi_per_image]{ndi_per_image()}}}

\item{sceneProportion}{A list of the proportions of different scene, created
by \code{\link[=waterscene_proportion]{waterscene_proportion()}}}

\item{ndtriPixels}{A list of NDTrI per pixel of one or more years, created by
\code{\link[=seasonal_index_per_pixel]{seasonal_index_per_pixel()}}}

\item{ndtriLake}{A list of NDTrI data per lake of one or more years, created by
\code{\link[=aggregate_NDTrI]{aggregate_NDTrI()}}}

\item{save_plots}{If TRUE all maps and plots are saved.}

\description{
Maps are saved as .html file, plots as .png, R objects as .rds and a
summary is saved as csv table. The folder where data is saved is a subfolder
